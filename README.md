Computational biologists are frequently engaged in collaborative data analysis with wet lab researchers. These interdisciplinary projects, as necessary as they are to the scientific endeavour, can be surprisingly challenging due to cultural differences in operations and values. In these Ten Simple Rules guide we aim to help dry lab researchers identify sources of friction; and provide actionable tools to facilitate respectful, open, transparent and rewarding collaborations.
