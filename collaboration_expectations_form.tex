        The wet lab people determine the experimental design/strategy, the dry lab people determine the analysis strategy & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & Both experimental and analysis strategies are to be discussed and jointly agreed on by both parties \\ \hline
        Analysis plan and experimental design are to be discussed once the data has been collected & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & Analysis plan and experimental design should be discussed and fixed prior to data collection \\ \hline

        \textbf{Communication and functioning} & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ \\ \hline
        Meetings should be held on a regular (e.g. monthly/biweekly) basis, and simply be brief if there was no development & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & Meetings should be organized whenever they are needed (e.g. to discuss results or problems) \\ \hline

        To each his/her expertise & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & All parties are expected to try to learn and understand what the others are doing \\ \hline

        What matters is excellent science - and hence high impact factor & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & What matters is sound, robust science \\ \hline
        We should make code/data available if we are forced to & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & By default everything should be openly available, latest by publication time (whether pre-print or final paper) \\ \hline
        Everything should be published as pre-print & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & Never mention anything unless itâ€™s actually published by a journal \\ \hline
        The people doing the experiments are first authors, the dry lab people are somewhere after that & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & The people analyzing and making sense of the data are first authors or first co-authors \\ \hline
        Negative or inconclusive results are sadly unglamorous, but happen and are part of science & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & ~ & If you have negative or inconclusive results, it means you haven't looked hard enough or given it proper attention \\ \hline
