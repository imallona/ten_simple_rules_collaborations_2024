Dear %PRODTASK_ASSIGNEDBY%,

My %PRODTASK% assignment has been completed.


Author Comments:


Thank you for processing our submission.

We have checked all authors affiliations and agree with your updated metadata "The authors received no specific funding for this work", "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.", and title "Ten simple rules for computational biologists collaborating with wet lab researchers". We have added the corresponding author within the LaTeX template, and removed postcodes from affiliations.

Regarding your manuscript requirements:

> 1. Your [PRIMEarxiv.sty, expectations_table_resubmission.tex] file is currently uploaded as file type 'Other', and will therefore not be published with the article. If this file is intended for publication, please change the file type from 'Other' to 'Supporting Information' as appropriate. If this file is intended to be included as Supporting Information, please also include a legend for it in the Supporting Information Legends section of your manuscript. If this file contains your Response to Reviewer comments, please change the file type to 'Response to Reviewers'.

Thank you, `PRIMEarxiv.sty` is no longer needed and the supplementary table `expectations_table_resubmission.tex` is now just a PDF file named `formatted_supplementary_table.pdf` and Supporting information indeed.

> 2. We noted that you had the following present in your manuscript [Financial Disclosure/ Author Contributions].
> We have removed this section from your manuscript file as this information is automatically pulled from the submission form. 

Thank you.

> 3. Your references need to be formatted according to the ICMJE standard reference style. PLOS uses the numbered citation [citation-sequence] method and first six authors, et al. Authors should be listed as "Last name, First Initial". Please note that references should be cited in square [ ] brackets and not round ( ) brackets to ensure that they are correctly typeset. Additionally, the reference list should be formatted as “1.” and not “[1]”. Please adhere to the PLOS style for all references and include any urls as appropriate. For a full outline see our Author Guidelines:
https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/submission-guidelines#loc-references

We have switched to the PLoS latex template, this has been fixed.

>4. We noted that you had the following present in your manuscript [ List of keywords], and it appears that the statement in the manuscript differs from the information we have on file in your submission form. 

> The submission form states the following: [currently missing]. The manuscript statement, however, states [collaboration · interdisciplinary · statistics · biology · bioinformatics].
Could you please verify which of these two statements is correct?

We have removed the keywords from the latex document. Indeed [collaboration · interdisciplinary · statistics · biology · bioinformatics] are correct, and we plan to add them to the submission form.

> 5. Please ensure that all authors have at least one affiliation listed on the title page. 
>Affiliations should include a department (if applicable), an institution, a city, and a country (no postcode). 

Done

> 6. Please indicate the corresponding author on the title page with an asterisk (*) and include the corresponding author's email address. Only an asterisk and the email address itself are required.

Done.

> 7. We note that you may not have used the PLOS LaTeX template. Please be sure that you are familiar with our LaTeX guidelines to help reduce the chance of delay due to typesetting errors. Our guidelines can be found here: 
http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/latex

We have updated the .tex to make use of the PLoS latex template.

> 8. Please ensure that you have provided a single, cohesive .tex file for your LaTeX submission. As stated in the PLOS template, your references should be included in your .tex file (not submitted separately as .bib or .bbl). Please also ensure that you are making any formatting changes to both your .tex file and the PDF of your manuscript. If you have any questions, please contact Latex@plos.org. You can find our LaTeX guidelines here: 
http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/latex

Done.

> 9. Please ensure that all main figures and legends are referenced in the manuscript as Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 1A etc. (including capitalization and NO full stop after the word Fig), rather than Figure 1, Figure 2, etc. Please note, however, that the file names themselves must not include the space, i.e. Fig1.tif, Fig2.eps. Please use the following examples of naming conventions for citing multiple figures in your manuscript:

Done.


Thank you,
